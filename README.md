# football-api
The project is designed to provide an API to access a web server, which then calls a webscraper on the back end that scrapes football data

Project stages:
1. Create basic webserver, that can provide data when called as an API
2. Create webscraper that provides data
3. Store data in dynamodb
4. Migrate webserver to AWS lambda and configure serverless architecture
